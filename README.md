# Embedded-Systems-Project-RFID-Access-Control-using-STM32F446RETx
RFID-based access control system implemented on STM32F446RETx (ARM Cortex-M4). This project demonstrates the use of an STM32 microcontroller to read RFID tags, validate IDs, and control output peripherals. The firmware is programmed using C. Ideal as an embedded systems academic project  for RFID integration on STM32.

The real readme is in the PDF ES(11).pdf
